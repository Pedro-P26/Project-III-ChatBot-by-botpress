# Bot Incorporation - Project III

## 📌 About the Project
This project was developed as part of the Project III course in the Computer Engineering degree at the Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo. The main objective was to create a functional chatbot using Botpress and integrate it into the "myIPVC" mobile application and, potentially, the "ON" platform and the institution's portal.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an interactive chatbot for integration into the "myIPVC" mobile application.
- Explore implementation in other platforms such as the "ON" panel and a WordPress portal.
- Enhance digital interaction within the IPVC educational ecosystem.
- Create a chatbot capable of providing concise answers.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used
- **Botpress**: Open-source platform for chatbot development.
- **React Native**: Framework for developing the "myIPVC" mobile application.
- **PHP**: Used in the "ON" platform for chatbot integration.
- **WordPress**: Platform for the portal where chatbot integration was tested.
- **Android Studio** and **Visual Studio Code**: IDEs used in development.
- **GitHub**: Version control and code collaboration.
- **Trello**: Task management and project tracking.

## 🚀 Developed Features
- **Chatbot Integrated into myIPVC**: Displayed within a modal inside the application.
- **Chatbot on the ON Panel**: Implemented in a test environment for functionality evaluation.
- **Direct and Concise Responses**: The chatbot provides short and precise answers, avoiding lengthy texts.


## 📉 Challenges and Future Improvements
### 🔴 Challenges
- Learning and adapting to Botpress and its tools.
- Integration into the WordPress portal was not completed due to the requirement of a paid plan.

### 🔵 Future Improvements
- Display a default message when the chatbot cannot provide an answer.
- Improve response accuracy and expand the knowledge base.
- Complete the integration into the WordPress portal for broader support.
